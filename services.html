                Elon Musk -SpaceX
              </a></h4>
            <p>In 2010 SpaceX first launched its Falcon 9, a bigger craft so named for its use of nine engines, and the following year it broke ground on a launch site for the Falcon Heavy, a craft the company hoped would be the first to break the $1,000-per-pound-to-orbit cost barrier and that might one day be used to transport astronauts into deep space. In December 2010 the company reached another milestone, becoming the first commercial company to release a spacecraft—the Dragon capsule—into orbit and successfully return it to Earth. Dragon again made history on May 25, 2012, when it became the first commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS, to which it successfully delivered cargo. In August that year, SpaceX announced that it had won a contract from NASA to develop a successor to the space shuttle that would transport astronauts into space.</p>

            <p>She is one of the most successful authors of all time. Her name is literally synonymous with Harry Potter and has $1 billion. It is almost impossible to believe that only 20 years ago, Joanne Rowling was so poor that she and her child relied on government welfare to survive. After getting a meagre meal, Joanne would put her child to sleep and work voraciously on her first novel, 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. Once this book was published, the world loved her work so much that it was developed into a series of blockbuster movies. J.K. Rowling's life turned around for the better and she is a legitimate billionaire.</p>

When Edison was a child, his teachers called his parents regularly and tell them that their child is weak and can never succeed in life. His teachers were convinced that teaching a brain as slow as his, is a waste of time.
But no one knew that this person will invent so many things that people won’t forget him even after centuries! And the biggest learning of his success story were his 1000 attempts when he failed at his job. But he never stopped; his drive lead him to astonishing success and now he is one of the world’s most famous success stories.</p>

            <p>Once Dr Kalam went to Erode to attend a function sponsored by Sowbhagya wet grinders . On that occasion, they gave him a grinder as a gift. He refused to accept it but since he needed it he insisted on paying for it . He then sent a person to the shop with a <a href="https://theindianfeed.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/APJ-Abdul-Kalam-cheque-the-indian-feed.jpg">cheque</a> for Rs 4,850 dated August 25, 2014. The Managing Director of the company was reluctant to receive money from Kalam and did not encash the <a href="https://theindianfeed.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/APJ-Abdul-Kalam-cheque-the-indian-feed.jpg">cheque</a> for over a month. A month later , they received a call from Kalam’s office asking why the <a href="https://theindianfeed.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/APJ-Abdul-Kalam-cheque-the-indian-feed.jpg">cheque</a> has not been deposited. Further, Kalam directed them to deposit the <a href="https://theindianfeed.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/APJ-Abdul-Kalam-cheque-the-indian-feed.jpg">cheque</a> to avoid returning the grinder. The company agreed to deposit it. But they did not want to let go of the treasure and decided to keep a copy of the <a href="https://theindianfeed.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/APJ-Abdul-Kalam-cheque-the-indian-feed.jpg">cheque.</a> They got it scanned and have framed it. The very next day they deposited the cheque and received a message from Kalam’s office thanking them for doing so.
